## Material Icons Extended by Infragistics
This is an unofficial subset of icons that extends the official [Material Design Icon set](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) provided by Google.

### Purpose
We felt the Material Design Icon set is too limited and we wanted to extend it by designing additional icons that will fit well within the Material Design language.

### Scope
Initially we launch 230 icons distributed in 5 categories:
- Finance
- Health
- Logos
- Programming
- Social Media

We will be adding more icons and we will try to make the icon set available to as many platforms as possible. Right now we only provide SVG files so you can use them as you see fit.

The initial target for this set is to work with our [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) UI framework by utilizing the `igx-icon` component and the Ignite UI for Angular Icon Service.

### Requests
Feel free to use the issue tracker to request new icons.

### Where is the web font?
We are discussing the provision of additional icon resources, including fonts, sprites, and framework components to make the icons available in many formats for different purposes.

We have limited resources and the initial effort was focused on providing as many icons as we can in a short period of time. We felt the SVG format is a great starting place.
